This is part 1 of a tutorial series that covers all about Nix. You can find the
rest here:

import NixTuto from "../../../components/NixTuto.astro";

<NixTuto/>

In this tutorial series, I want to give a broad view of Nix and NixOS, covering
every aspect. I want to cover the topics in the *just enough* level of detail.
This means, some topics will have a more detailed explanation, while some
details will be hand-waved -- this is not a hacker's handbook.

The source code of my blog is open source software at
[viperML/neohome](https://github.com/viperML/neohome). You are invited to
contribute to it, improving the wording of the text, fixing the technical
details, or whatever you want.


## What is Nix and NixOS?

Nix can be defined as a purely functional package manager, that enables
reproducible and declarative builds and deployments. That is quite to unpack:

- *Package manager*: the role of Nix is similar to the ones of apt and dnf in
other Linux distributions. It is the software that organizes the rest of your
software, and the dependencies between them. Nix can also handle packages from
the language-specific ecosystems, like Python or NPM. It also runs on macOS.
- *Purely functional*: Nix is also a functional programming language. We define
packages in this language, and use the command line to "instantiate" the
functional data structures that represent packages, into the disk. People
describe the Nix the language as "JSON with functions" or "Haskell without
types".
- *Reproducible*: in math, function produce the same values given the same
inputs. *f(x) = xÂ²* doesn't depend on the time of the day. Similarly, we call
*pure function* in programming to functions that only depend on their inputs.
Nix applies this approach to software packaging, by having a tight sandbox to
build the packages in, and a purely functional language to describe the
instructions.
- *Declarative*: instead of running multiple commands, we define files that
collect all the details. This way, nothing is lost on countless lines of our
shell history.

Some of the key features of the package manager are:

- It can run on top of any Linux distribution, like Debian or Arch.
- MacOS is also supported, as well as ARM64 targets for Linux and Mac.
- Packages are stored independently of the system in `/nix/store`
- Packages are addressed by a cryptographic hash of their inputs and build
procedure. Multiple packages of the same name can coexist in the same system, if
they refer to different binaries:
  ```console
  $ find /nix/store -maxdepth 1 | grep "fish-3.7.1\$"
  /nix/store/qkjx3hgnpdvyg3m7973dh4hr1jxbqphw-fish-3.7.1
  /nix/store/5c27daphi2jn4aj714pf8jvdqn087989-fish-3.7.1
  /nix/store/9g2wgp6wgl8z2x3ikqab0x8dlbqj3b63-fish-3.7.1
  ```
- There is no global library path for packages built with Nix. Each package
referes to their inputs explicitely:
  ```console
  $ ldd /nix/store/qkjx3hgnpdvyg3m7973dh4hr1jxbqphw-fish-3.7.1/bin/fish
          linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fd3a1f1c000)

  ```

### A bit of history

Nix starts as a research project in the Netherlands in 2003. Eelco Dolstra publishes
his PhD thesis [The Purely Functional Software Deployment
Model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf), that covers the
deficiencies of the existing packaging solutions and presents the very first
version of Nix. Soon after, a complete Linux distribution based on Nix was born:
NixOS.

Since then, NixOS has had bi-yearly releases, and the repository holding the
package definition, nixpkgs, has grown to be the biggest repository ever.

We also find in the landscape, Guix and Spack, which follow the original ideas
of Eelco, but adding their own twist to it.

- [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) use the Scheme language, which is of the Lisp
family. Guix System also uses its own init system, called *Shepherd*.
- [Spack](https://spack.io) uses Python, and focuses on unprivileged and highly
configurable installations at compute centers.

### Key concepts

- Nix refers to Nix the program and Nix the language.
- We use Nix (the program) to evaluate code written in Nix (the language).
- A derivation is a type of value, that can produce an output in the
`/nix/store`.
- Packages can be 1:1 derivations, but derivations are very cheap to create.
- Knowing the Nix language is fundamental to understanding how to use the Nix
command line, because they operate in Nix expressions.
- [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) is the repository that contains
the collection of all Nix packages. It is distributed independently of Nix, the
program.

### More resources

I invite you to look a the different resources to learn Nix, either the
reference manuals or other guides and tutorials:

- [nix.dev](https://nix.dev): official guides and tutorials
- [Nix manual](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable): documentation of
the language and the CLI.
- [Nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable): documentation of
the abstractions used in nixpkgs.
- [NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable): documentation and usage
  of the operation system, and of the module system.
- [NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org): community forum
where you can ask anything related to Nix.

## Nix repl and nix eval

We begin our journey by taking a tour over the Nix language. To get a nice grasp
about Nix as a whole, it is important to know about the language, instead of
mindlessly running commands in our terminal -- we will do that in the last
episode.

We can either write Nix code in a file ending with an extension `.nix`, or use
`nix repl` to evaluate expressions in a "command line"-like experience:

- `nix repl`: to type your expressions in the **command-line**.
- `nix eval`: to type your expressions in a **file**.

You are free to use whichever. I would recommend putting the expressions in a
nix file and using your code editor. It will be easier to edit your code when it
spans multiple lines, and you will be able to back-up your progress.

So, open in your favorite text editor any filename ending in `.nix`. Note that
Nix doesn't have any project structure, or any special filenames.

```nix
# tuto.nix
"Hello world!"
```

```console
$ nix eval -f ./tuto.nix
"Hello World!"
```

I may use comments to show the output of an expression, to simplify the code
blocks:

```nix
"Hello world!"
#=> "Hello world!"
```

## Types

Nix is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't write the type of a
value. Instead, it is calculated at runtime. Nix is also a very simple language,
and it has very few types.

> [!NOTE]
> One of the objectives of Nix is software reproducibility, so it needs a
> very simple language to use a base. You wouldn't want to add new features
> every year, making it impossible to use old Nix code.


I like to have a mental model of types in Nix, where we find the categories:

- Primitive types
- Compound types: attribute sets and lists
- Functions

### Primitive types

#### Strings

This is the most important type in Nix. Strings behave mostly like in any other
programming language. You have 2 variants of a string:

- `"foo"`, with single double quotes
- `''foo''`, with double single quotes

The difference is that `''foo''` **trims the leading whitespace**. This is useful
for multiline strings, where you will see them used.

```nix
''
  export FOO=BAR
''
```

You can also interpolate values with `${}` inside a string:

```nix
''
  export FOO=${ "A" + "B" }
''
#=> "export FOO=AB\n"
```

Strings can be concatenated with `+`.


#### Booleans

We have `true` and `false`. You will use them for `if ...`.

#### Null

Apart from the booleans, we also have `null`. You may see it in NixOS modules,
to signify the lack of some configuration.

`null` and `false` are different. You can't use `null` in `if ...`.


#### Numbers

Mostly used for demonstration purposes, you probably won't
see any number in the wild. Nix has `int` and `float` types, which coerce
automagically.

```nix
1 + 2 * 2 / 1.1
#=> 4.63636
```

#### Paths

Nix also has a built-in type for paths. There are occasions that you will want a
path instead of a string containing a path, which are mostly relevant to flakes.

But, for an introduction, you can use either strings or paths indifferently.

```nix
/usr/bin/env
#=> /usr/bin/env
```


### Compound types

These types are made of any of the other values. While lists collect **unnamed**
values, attribute sets collects **named** values.

#### Lists

Lists are **space separated**, and are heterogeneous. This means you can mix any
other type of value inside:

```nix
[
  1
  "hello"
  [
    "nested list"
  ]
]
```

As a style guide, we put new items in new lines. This helps the human reader
parse the different elements.

You can concatenate lists with the double plus sign `++`:

```nix
[ 1 ] ++ [ 2 ]
#=> [ 1 2 ]
```

#### Attribute sets

Or **attrsets** for short, are a collection of key-value pairs.
The keys must be valid identifiers (not expressions), and the values can be of
any types. The **semicolons** are obligatory.

```nix
{
  foo = "bar";
  x = [ 0 ];
}
```

You can nest attribute sets freely. However, there is some special syntax
shorthand for it. Note that this is only possible when you are writing nested
attrsets.

```nix
{
  a = {
    b = "c";
  };
  # or shortened:
  a.b = "c";
}
```

To select an item from an attrset, you use a dot `.`:

```nix
{
  x = 1;
  y = 2;
}.x
#=> 1
```

The keyword `inherit x` is a shorthand for `x = x`.


```nix
let
  foo = "value";
in
  {
    # these two are equivalent
    foo = foo;
    inherit foo;
  }
```

> [!TIP]
> `inherit` is not related to inheritance in OOP languages. It is just a very
> simple syntax shorthand.

### Functions

It won't come as a surprise, that functions are the most important type in Nix,
which is a functional language. Functions are defined with the following syntax:

```nix
argument: body

# sometimes you need parenthesis
(argument: body)
```

To apply a function, you use a single space:

```nix
(x: x + 1) 2
#=> 3
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Functions take a **single** argument, and return a **single** value from its
body.

While this might seem like a limitation, you can write functions that take
multiple values in two ways. One way, is to take an attrset as an argument, which then you can decompose:

```nix
x: x.foo + x.bar
```

To help with this common pattern, there is some special syntax for decomposing
the input. Don't confuse this syntax with how you declare an attrset, this is
just for functions:

```nix
x: x.foo + x.bar
# equivalent to
{ foo, bar }: foo + bar
```

To accept multiple argument, it is also possible to use *functions that return
functions*. In the following example, the outer function return another
function. So you can apply it *twice* to get the final value:

```nix
foo: (bar: foo + bar)
```

You can call this function with `1`, and then call the returned function again
with `2`. 

```nix
# ~pseudo-code~

f = foo: (bar: foo + bar)

# substituting foo=1
(bar: 1 + bar)

# substituting bar=2
1 + 2

#=> 3

# Which is the same as:
f 1 2
#=> 3
```

One way to know if you are dealing with functions or *partially-applied*
functions, is that Nix displays them as `lambda`:

```nix
(x: y: x + y)
#=> Â«lambdaÂ»
#=> you can't print a function

(x: y: x + y) 1
#=> Â«lambdaÂ»
#=> still the inner lambda

(x: y: x + y) 1 2
#=> 3
```

> [!WARNING]
> Both functions and lists are aware of spaces: functions use space for
> application, and lists are space-separated. Lists take precedence over
> functions. Be careful when applying functions inside lists:
> ```nix
> [
>   f 1    # two elements, f and 1
>   (f 1)  # the result of applying f 1
> ]
> ```

## Compound expressions

One of the key insights to understanding Nix's syntax, is that everything is an
expression. Expressions can be nested into another. Unlike a regular language,
there are no "statements" in Nix. Statements run one after the other.

An statement would imply multiple values. In contrast, in Nix we have a single
expression, that evaluates from the bottom.

One way to visualize this, is by adding parenthesis for every expression:

```nix
# Given the following expression:
[ 1 ] ++ [ { foo = x: y + 1; } ]

# From the bottom:
(expr) ++ (expr)

[ (expr) ] ++ [ (expr) ]

[ 1 ] ++ [ { foo = (expr); } ]
```

In the following sections, we will look at some of the special syntax that nix
has, that prefixes expressions.

### if-then-else

The syntax for if is the following:

```nix
if expr-cond then expr-true else expr-false
```

Given `expr-cond`, if it evaluates to `true`, then the `expr-true` is selected.
If it evaluates to `false`, then `expr-false` is used. Otherwise, if you pass
any other type, a runtime error is raised.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `if-then-else` is an expression, you can handle like any regular value.

This means, you can use it as any other expression, for example as attrset keys,
as return values of functions or anything more or less complex:

```nix
{
  config = if useCuda then "cuda" else "noCuda";

  # using parenthesis to visualize the expressions
  config' = (if (useCuda) then ("cuda") else ("noCuda");
}
```

You can "fake" an else-if, by nesting another if-expression in the `expr-false`
branch:

```nix
(if false
 then "a"
 else (if true
       then "b"
       else "c"))
```


### let-in

`let-in` is a **prefix** to any expression, that allows us to factor out code.
The syntax is the following:

```nix
let
  x = (expr);
  y = (expr);
in
  (expr)
```

The syntax is similar to how we declare attrsets `{ x = (expr); }`, but without
the curly braces.

When we need to repeat the usage of some variable, we will be using a `let-in`
most of the time. You might have seen the following example to create a shell:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
  # pkgs => { mkShell = ...; hello = ...; .... }
in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    packages = [
      pkgs.hello
    ];
  }
```

### with

`with` is a weird one. It allows you to put all the keys of an attrset,
in the scope of the target expression. The syntax is the following.

```nix
with (expr-with); (expr)
```

Note that the first expr must evaluate to an attribute set. We can use `with` to
factor out code in the following way:

```nix
with {
  x = 1;
  y = 2;
}; (x+y)
```

This is oddly similar to `let-in`. The key difference is that the argument to
`with` can be a variable that we receive as input, or the result of some
computation. For example:

```nix
with (import <nixpkgs> {});
mkShell {
  packages = [
    hello
  ];
}
```

## Builtins

In this section, we will cover some functions from `builtins`. This is the name
of a variable that is provided by Nix itself. I will cover some of the most used
ones. You can check the documentation for the rest in the
[Nix manual](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/language/builtins).

### import

`import` allows you to load a nix expression from another file. Remember that
nix is an expression-based language, so a file always contains a single expression
that evaluates to a single value.

```nix
# foo.nix
let y = 2; in {
  x = 1;
  z = y + 2;
}

import ./foo.nix
#=> { x = 1; z = 4; }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you pass a **folder** to `import`, it will try to read the
> `folder/default.nix` file inside it. `default.nix` is the only "special"
> filename that we have in Nix.

A common use case is to import a file, and then immediately after evaluate the
function that it evaluates to:

```nix
(import ./foo.nix) "myinput"
```

This is how the nixpkgs repo has its `default.nix` set-up. It takes an attrset,
that is used to configure nixpkgs:

```nix
# <nixpkgs> is the "global" nixpkgs installation
# it returns a path
<nixpkgs>
#=> /nix/store/qpg5mwsind2hy35b9vpk6mx4jimnypw0-source

import <nixpkgs>
# Â«lambdaÂ»

(import <nixpkgs>) {}
#=> {
#   hello = <drv>;
#   python3 = <drv>;
#   ....
# }

# you can omit the parenthesis
import <nixpkgs> {}
```

> [!TIP]
> I recommend loading nixpkgs in a `nix repl`, and exploring the resulting
attrset. You can either use `pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {}`, or the repl command
`:l <nixpkgs>`, which evaluates it with the empty attrset.



### map

`map f list` applies the function `f` to each element of a `list`. When you think of a `for`
loop in other languages, you can mostly translate it to `map`.

```nix
builtins.map (x: "workspace-${builtins.toString x}") [ 1 2 3 ]
#=> [
#   "workspace-1"
#   "workspace-2"
#   "workspace-3"
# ]
```


### filter

`filter f list`, as map, applies f to each element of the list. But it removes
elements for which the function returns `false`, and keeps the element if `f`
returns `true`.

```nix
builtins.filter (x: builtins.stringLength x > 1) ["f" "bar"]
#=> [ "bar" ]
```

### mapAttrs, filterAttrs

These are the equivalent to `map` and `filter`, but can be applied to
attrsets instead of lists. They take a *curried* functions, for the name and
value.

```nix
builtins.mapAttrs (name: value: "${name}:${value}") { foo = "bar"; }
#=> { foo = "foo:bar"; }
```

### readFile, fromTOML, fromJSON

Unlike `import`, which reads a file and loads its nix expression, `readFile`
reads a file and loads them as a string. It can be useful to factor out a big
string into a separate file.

`fromTOML` and `fromJSON` try to convert a Nix string into a valid Nix value,
usually an attrset or list of other "simple" values. You may see it in
combination with `readFile`.

```nix
builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./package.json)
#=> {
#   name = "neohome";
#   ...
# }
```

### foldl'

Finally, I want to mention `foldl'`. It allows you to take a list, and generate
a single value out of it. How the value is generated, depends on what *folding*
function you pass to it. You also need to provide the *nul* element, from which
the list is folded from.

For example, you can implement the "sum of all numbers in a list", by folding
the list, with the sum function and 0 as the nul element.

```nix
builtins.foldl' (left: right: left + right) 0 [ 1 2 3 4 ]
#=> 10
```

## Nixpkgs' standard library

Many other utility functions are implemented in nixpkgs. These are implemented
on top of `builtins`, so they are not required to be part of Nix itself. Some of
them can be rewritten easily -- for example the identity function `lib.id = x: x`, but
in general you will be using them quite often.

You can get `lib` from a `pkgs` instance, and it is also part of the argument of
NixOS modules. We are writing an standalone nix file, so to get `lib` into scope
we can use the following:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
  inherit (pkgs) lib;
in
  lib.id 3
  #=> 3
```

We will cover some nice functions from `lib`, but as with `builtins`, I don't
want you to memorize them. Instead, just keep in the back of
your head that they exist.

### traceVal

Based on `builtins.trace`, it allows you to print a value into the console. All
you need to do is wrap a value with `traceVal`, and make sure you evaluate it.

This will be useful for "print-debugging" functions, so don't underestimate its
value.


```nix
builtins.map (x: (lib.traceVal x) + 1) [ 2 3 4 ]
#=> [
# trace: 2
# 3
# trace: 3
# 4
# trace: 4
# 5
# ]
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember that Nix is an expression-based language. `traceVal` doesn't behave
> like a print statement, but rather it is a function that takes a value and
> returns it, printing the value as an effect.

### flatten

`flatten list` takes a list with lists inside, and transforms it into a "flat"
list.

```nix
lib.flatten [ [ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] ]
#=> [
#   1
#   2
#   3
#   4
# ]
```

> [!TIP]
> `flatten` is very useful when used with `map`, as it allows `map` to "return
> multiple values" in the mapping function:
> ```nix
> lib.flatten (builtins.map (x: [ "left-${x}" "right-${x}" ]) ["foo" "bar"])
> #=> [
> #   "left-foo"
> #   "right-foo"
> #   "left-bar"
> #   "right-bar"
> # ]
> ```

### listToAttrs, attrsToList

More often than not, you need to pass a list to an API that takes an attrset, or
viceversa. The conversion is not trivial, but you can use these funtions to do
so.

To convert an attrset to a list, there are multiple ways to do it:

```nix
lib.attrsToList { foo = "foovalue"; bar = "barvalue"; }
#=> [
#   {
#     name = "bar";
#     value = "barvalue";
#   }
#   {
#     name = "foo";
#     value = "foovalue";
#   }
# ]

builtins.attrValues { foo = "foovalue"; bar = "barvalue"; }
#=> [
#   "barvalue"
#   "foovalue"
# ]

builtins.attrNames { foo = "foovalue"; bar = "barvalue"; }
#=> [
#   "bar"
#   "foo"
# ]
```

For `listToAttrs`, you may need to do some conversion with `map` before feeding
the result. This is because, `listToAttrs` expects a list with attrs inside:

```nix
lib.listToAttrs (builtins.map (pkg: { name = pkg.name; value = pkg; }) [ pkgs.hello pkgs.coreutils ])
#=> {
#   "coreutils-9.5" = Â«derivation /nix/store/57hlz5fnvfgljivf7p18fmcl1yp6d29z-coreutils-9.5.drvÂ»;
#   "hello-2.12.1" = Â«derivation /nix/store/crmj28zg09517n5sskml9fmy2c6r3rsr-hello-2.12.1.drvÂ»;
# }
```

### concatStrings

A common abstractionm pattern, is to factor out a big string, into a list of
strings. As you know, you can then reduce a list to a single value with
`builtins.foldl'`, but the standard library provides a family of functions that
concatenate strings: `concatStrings`, `concatStringsSep`, etc.

```nix
lib.concatStringsSep "\n" [ "export A=B" "export B=C" ]
#=> "export A=B\nexport B=C"
```

### makeSearchPath, makeBinPath, makeLibraryPath

When dealing with packages, you will often deal with search paths. These are
environment variables used in Linux, that follow the same pattern
`elem:elem:elem`. For example, the `PATH` environment variable. You can create
search paths with `concatStringsSep` and `map`, but the standard library
provides some shorthands for this common task:

```nix
lib.makeBinPath [ "" "/usr" "/usr/local" ]
#=> "/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin"

lib.makeLibraryPath [ pkgs.hello pkgs.coreutils ]
#=> "/nix/store/yb84nwgvixzi9sx9nxssq581pc0cc8p3-hello-2.12.1/lib:/nix/store/0kg70swgpg45ipcz3pr2siidq9fn6d77-coreutils-9.5/lib"
```

## Advanced topics

Finally, I want to mention some advanced topics that are part of the base
language. If you are just getting started with Nix, you might not need to know
about this. Or you might want to read ahead because of curiosity.

### Merging attribute sets

I decided to skip the merging operator `//` when talking about attrsets. It
takes two attrsets, and inserts the keys from the right-hand side into the
left-hand side. Notice that this definition is very specific to what it does: **it
does not try to merge any child attrsets**. Looking at an example:

```nix
{ a = "avalue"; b = { ba = "bavalue"; bc = "bcvalue"; }; } // { b = 2; c = "cvalue"; }
#=> {
#   a = "avalue";
#   b = 2;
#   c = "cvalue";
# }
```

Notice that `c` was inserted, but also `b`, removing the nested attrset from the
left. This can have negative consequences, as naively using `//` can lead to
problems.

Merging attrsets is not something that you will do commonly. A prefered approach
would be to create a new attrset, and explicitly listing the key-value pairs
with `inherit`.

```nix
let c = "avalue"; b = { ba = "bavalue"; }; in { b = { inherit c; inherit (b) ba; }; }
#=> {
#   b = {
#     ba = "bavalue";
#     c = "avalue";
#   };
# }
```

### Recursion

You can achieve complex behavior by using the different mechanism for recursion
in Nix. One way is using `let-in`, which has a scope in which you can refer to
the item itself:

```nix
let
  x = [ x ];
in
  x
#=> [[[[ ... ]]]]
```

Because `x` itself is in scope, you can create the list that contains itself
(forever). Of course, this is a useless example, but there are other patterns
that are best (or only) implemented with recursion.

The nixpkgs lib also offers `lib.fix`, which has a simple definition:

```nix
fix =
  f:
  let
    x = f x;
  in
  x;
```

Fix takes a function, and applies the function using the **result** of the
function as its argument. Trippy, eh? This allows us to write very compact
self-referencing values:

```nix
lib.fix (self: { a = 1; b = self.a + 1; })
#=> {
#   a = 1;
#   b = 2;
# }
```

Nix also provides the `rec` keyword that can be prefixed to attsets, and
provides a similar experience to `fix`, but with an implicit scope similar to
let-in:

```nix
rec { a = 1; b = a + 1; }
#=> {
#   a = 1;
#   b = 2;
# }
```

I prefer to use `fix`, because it is more explicit about where things come --
you have to mention your function argument `self`, but you can choose whichever
you want.

### builtins.toString and string interpolation

There are two ways to convert some value to an string: `builtins.toString` and
using string interpolation. They follow different semantics. You could say that
string interpolation is a subset of what you can do with `toString`.

```nix
builtins.toString true
#=> "1"

"${true}"
#=> error: cannot coerce a Boolean to a string: true
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> However, the most important type that you *can* string interpolate are attrsets.
> Attrsets will use its attribute `outPath` (a string) or `__toString` (a function).
> ```nix
> "${ { outPath = "/usr"; } }/bin"
> #=> "/usr/bin"
> ```


## Finale

I hope you got a broad idea about how Nix itself works. In this lesson we
learnt:

- What Nix is, and that we need to learn the Nix language to give us
superpowers.
- The basic types of the Nix language, such as strings and booleans
- The compound types: lists and attrsets
- Functions and how to apply them
- The most useful functions from `builtins` and `pkgs.lib`

Continue in the next episode of this series, where we start building packages,
with `builtins.derivation`:
